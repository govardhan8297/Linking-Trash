        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PlayerUnknown's
        Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game
        developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South
        Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods
        that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games,
        inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a
        standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to
        one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons
        and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves.
        The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time,
        directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The
        last player or team standing wins the round. Battlegrounds was first
        released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in
        March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also
        released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview
        program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. A
        free-to-play mobile version for Android and iOS was released in 2018, in
        addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia
        streaming platform was released in April 2020. Battlegrounds is one of
        the best-selling and most-played video games of all time. By 2019, the
        PC and console versions of the game have sold over 60 million copies, in
        addition to PUBG Mobile having crossed 600 million downloads.
        Battlegrounds received positive reviews from critics, who found that
        while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of
        gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level
        and was highly replayable. The game was attributed to popularizing the
        battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also
        being produced following its success. The game also received several
        Game of the Year nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation
        has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help
        with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become
        a popular esport. The game has also been banned in some countries for
        allegedly being harmful and addictive to younger players.
