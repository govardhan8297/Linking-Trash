        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school is an
        educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning
        environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the
        direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education,
        which is commonly compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress
        through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country
        (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary
        school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have
        completed primary education. An institution where higher education is
        taught, is commonly called a university college or university, but these
        higher education institutions are usually not compulsory. <br />In
        addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also
        attend schools before and after primary (Elementary in the US) and
        secondary (Middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or preschool
        provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3â€“5).
        University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available
        after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular
        field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. Alternative
        schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.Non-government
        schools, called also known as private schools[3] may be required when
        the government does not supply adequate, or specific educational needs.
        Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools,
        Gurukula,Hindu School, madrasa, hawzas (Shi'a schools), yeshivas (Jewish
        schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of
        education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for
        adults include institutions of corporate training, military education
        and training and business schools.
